> **Note — Architecture-level document**: This document describes *what the component is and why it is structured this way*. Code must follow the architecture, not the opposite. Logical component and interface names are the vocabulary of architecture and belong here. What must be avoided: source file paths, implementation class names (e.g. `FooImpl`), and code-level algorithmic details.
>
> **Diagrams**: All visuals must be either a Mermaid fenced code block (` ```mermaid `) or ASCII art inline
> in the document. External image references (`![alt](path)`) are **not allowed**.
>
> Sequence diagrams, block diagrams, component diagrams, and state machines (Mermaid syntax) are allowed and encouraged.

## Assumptions & Constraints

> List the assumptions that were true when this architecture was designed, and the hard constraints that shaped
> the decisions (e.g., no dynamic memory, 20 kHz control loop, single-core MCU, fixed bus topology).
> Use a bulleted list or table. Be explicit — an unstated assumption is a hidden risk.

## System Overview

> Provide a high-level narrative of the component's place in the system. Answer: what problem does it solve,
> what are its main responsibilities, and what are its primary interactions with surrounding components?
> A block diagram is required here.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[External System / Caller] --> B[This Component]
    B --> C[Hardware Peripheral / Dependency]
    B --> D[Another Subsystem]
```

---

## Component Decomposition

> Decompose the component into its sub-components or modules. Explain the responsibility of each.
> Show structural relationships (containment, aggregation, association) with a component diagram.
> Do NOT enumerate classes — describe logical units of responsibility.

| Sub-component | Responsibility |
|---------------|----------------|
| …             | …              |

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph ThisComponent["This Component"]
        A[Sub-component A]
        B[Sub-component B]
        C[Sub-component C]
    end
    A --> B
    B --> C
```

## Interfaces & Contracts

> Describe every interface that external callers use to interact with this component, and every interface
> this component depends on. For each interface, state: its direction (provided / required), its purpose,
> and its invariants (pre/post-conditions, timing requirements, error semantics).
> Use a table or numbered list. No code — describe behavior only.

### Provided Interfaces

| Interface | Direction | Purpose | Invariants |
|-----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| …         | provided  | …       | …          |

### Required Interfaces

| Interface | Direction | Purpose | Invariants |
|-----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| …         | required  | …       | …          |

## Data Flow

> Trace the flow of data through the component from input to output. A sequence diagram or data-flow
> diagram is preferred over prose for complex flows.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Caller
    participant ThisComponent
    participant Dependency
    Caller->>ThisComponent: request(data)
    ThisComponent->>Dependency: fetch()
    Dependency-->>ThisComponent: result
    ThisComponent-->>Caller: response(result)
```

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

> Document concerns that span multiple sub-components: error handling strategy, logging/tracing policy,
> timing and scheduling guarantees, power management, safety / fault-tolerance requirements.

| Concern        | Policy / Approach |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Error handling | …                 |
| Timing budget  | …                 |
| Safety         | …                 |

## Open Questions & Decisions

> Track unresolved design questions and key architectural decisions already made. For each decision,
> record the options considered and the rationale for the chosen option.
